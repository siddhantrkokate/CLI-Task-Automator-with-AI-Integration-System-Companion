2. Use Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage Node.js and npm versions (recommended).
3. Change the ownership of the .npm directory to your user (if you know what you're doing).
4. Clear npm cache using 'npm cache clean --force' (use with caution).
Please try these solutions and run the script again.
