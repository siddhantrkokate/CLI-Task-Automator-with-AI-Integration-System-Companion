# CLI Task Automator using AI

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project solves the problem of manually performing routine and repetitive system tasks such as installations, updates, and generating small utility scripts. Using AI, the system allows users to enter a simple natural language prompt through the command line, automatically generates relevant Python code, and runs it in the background. If any errors occur, it retries by regenerating a corrected version until successful.

The goal is to reduce unnecessary clicks and automate everyday tasks using open-source tools and AI.


## 🚀 Features

- Natural language to Python code conversion

- Background execution of tasks

- Auto-correction and re-execution on error

- Handles system-level operations like:

-- Software version checks

-- Small tool creation (e.g., arithmetic calculator)

-- Utility execution (e.g., background remover for images)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language for logic and execution

- subprocess & os modules: For running background processes and system-level tasks

- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (Free version): For quick and lightweight AI code generation

- Meta Llama 3.3 (70B) via Ola Krutrim Cloud: Main model used for accurate code generation and correction

## 📦 Requirements

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

1. Python 3.8+

2. Required Python packages:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```


## 📚 Learnings

- Deepened understanding of subprocess handling and error logging in Python

- Learned to set up AI model configurations and deal with the limitations of free-tier AI tools

- Gained experience automating end-to-end task flows with fallback correction logic

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Enable direct installation or uninstallation of applications via prompt (e.g., install whatsapp)

- Integrate AI with more everyday software to make interactions more intuitive and powerful

## 📄 Summary

This project demonstrates how natural language and AI can simplify routine system operations, helping bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution without needing clicks or detailed technical commands.
